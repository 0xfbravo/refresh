 # About
 This playground's a refresh project to solve some algorithms.
 The exercises in this playground are some study cases based on 'Cracking the coding interview' book.
 If there's any error or other optimal solution for the exercises, I'll try to reach them after.
 
 By default, there are two main classes `Naive` and `Optimal`.
 
 Every exercise has two extensions `Naive` and `Optimal`.
 
 Each playground page here has many exercises from the related chapter in the book.
 I hope that this playground helps you in a near future, feel free to comment and send me better solutions.
 By now, this is only a study playground to improve my coding under pressure abilities.
 
 
 Thank you for reading this, enjoy the file and happy coding!
 
 
 Best regards, Fellipe Bravo 🍎 🧑🏻‍💻
